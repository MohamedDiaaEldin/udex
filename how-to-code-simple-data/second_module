how to design function 

HTDF recipe 
- signature, purpose , sub 
	signature -> takes number and returns number 
	purpose   -> produce 2 times the given number 
	stub      -> define a function (correct function name , correct number of parametersm , produces dummy result of correct type)

- examples -> unit test the functions 
- inventory - template & constants 
	implement empty function for now 
- code body 
- test and debug




# switch in this language 

(define (is_tall number)
    (cond [(> number 10) "tall"]
          [(= number 10) "equal"]
          [else  "short"]
          
          
))


(writeln (is_tall 20 ))


Data definitions example

example trafic-light :
0 
1
2
color traffic light 0 is red, 1 yellow , 2 green

### Design data definitions - data driven for functions 
inforamatind about data of city problem in your app 

data definition of (city) 
examples : cairo , giza , alex 
produce True if the city is the best city in the world

function examplel is python 
	def is_best_city_in_the_world(city_name):
		return True if city_name == 'makah" else False


unit tests for both cases 
	isTrue(is_best_city_in_the_world('makah'))
	isFalse(is_best_city_in_the_world('anything'))




(VERY IMPORTANT EXAMPLE to define data)
- Other example  -manage ticket sales for theatre

# seatnum is natural[1, 32] 
notes for me --> from 1 to 32 inclusive
		if we type natural[1, 32) from 1 to 31 noninclusive

# interpretaions : seat number is in a row , 1 and 32 aisle seats
# examples  seat_1 = 1   aisle
	    seat_2 = 12  middle 
	    seat_3 = 32  aisle


- other exmaple
design a system to keep track of student grades, you are asked to design a data definition to represent the laetter grade in a course, which is one of A, B or c

# letterGrade is one of 
	- A
	- B
	- C
# interpretations: the letter grade in a course
# examples are reduant for enumerations
